# Privacy Policy – iPlusCode Chrome Extension

The **iPlusCode** Chrome extension helps you track Codeforces problems, view your friends’ accepted submissions, and maintain private notes. All data is stored **locally** on your device or within your **Chrome account sync storage**, and is only accessible to **you**.

---

## What We Store

- Your Codeforces handle  
- Bookmarked problems  
- Optional notes  
- A cached list of your Codeforces friends (for display purposes only)  
- Cached friend submissions for solved problems (kept only in your local browser storage for performance)

All of this data is managed using `chrome.storage.sync`, and **never leaves your device or browser**.

---

## What We Do Not Do

- ❌ Collect personal data  
- ❌ Track your browsing activity  
- ❌ Use cookies  
- ❌ Send or share any data to third-party servers (including ours – we don’t have a server)  
- ❌ Access your passwords or authentication data  

---

## Permissions Explanation

This extension requests access to `https://codeforces.com/*` to:

- Display accepted submissions of your Codeforces friends on problem pages  
- Fetch your friend list from the `/friends` page *(requires you to be logged in to Codeforces in your browser)*  
- Highlight which problems you have already solved  

These features rely on **public Codeforces data** or pages you’re already authenticated on. Your credentials are **never accessed, stored, or transmitted** by this extension.

---

## Data Removal

When you uninstall the extension, all stored data is automatically deleted from Chrome's storage.
